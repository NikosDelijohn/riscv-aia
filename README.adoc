= RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA)

The RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) builds upon the
interrupt-handling functionality of the basic RISC-V ISA to add support
mainly for the following:

* Message-signaled interrupts (MSIs) from devices.

* Direct control of device interrupts (as MSIs) by a guest operating
system running in virtual supervisor mode (VS mode), reducing the
reliance on regular hypervisor intervention.

* Additional standard local interrupts for RISC-V harts.

* Intermixing of priorities of local interrupts and device (external)
interrupts.

* Conditional delegation of local interrupts to lower privilege levels,
including to virtual machines.
